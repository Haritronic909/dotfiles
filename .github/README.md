# Dotfiles

Some of my configuration files used for my Arch Linux rice.

Feel free to try them out :)

Check out my BSPWM [rice](https://www.github.com/harishnkr/NewtonRice) that I maintain for my personal use.

You can install the config files by using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/). To install the configuration of a particular package, run ```stow <package-name>```, assuming that the repo is in the base of the home directory.
